Problem: Sorting a List of Student Scores

Problem Statement:
You are tasked with sorting a list of student scores in ascending order to prepare a report card. The input is a list of integers representing student scores, and the output should be the sorted list of scores.

You need to implement a sorting algorithm (such as Insertion Sort) to arrange the scores in ascending order.

Input:
- A list of integers representing the student scores.

Output:
- A sorted list of integers in ascending order.

Constraints:
- The list will contain at least one score (i.e., 1 ≤ len(scores) ≤ 1000).
- Scores will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.

Example:
Input:
scores = [85, 95, 76, 90, 92]

Output:
[76, 85, 90, 92, 95]

Input:
scores = [50, 60, 45, 72, 88, 91]

Output:
[45, 50, 60, 72, 88, 91]
