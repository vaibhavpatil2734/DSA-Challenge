Bubble Sort

Difficulty: Easy

Problem Statement:
Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. 
In Bubble Sort, adjacent elements are compared, and if they are in the wrong order, they are swapped. 
This process is repeated for all elements in the array until the array is sorted.

Algorithm:
1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
3. Swap the elements if the first element is greater than the second.
4. Repeat this process for all elements except the last sorted ones.
5. Continue until no swaps are needed (the array is sorted).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
Explanation: After performing Bubble Sort, the array becomes sorted in ascending order.

Input: arr[] = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
Explanation: The array is sorted step by step using Bubble Sort.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: The array is already sorted, so no swaps are needed.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^3
-10^3 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3
